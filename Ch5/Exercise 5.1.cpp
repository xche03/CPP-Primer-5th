/*Exercise 5.1: What is a null statement? When might you use a null
statement?*/
/*The simplest statement is the empty statement, also known as a null statement. A
null statement is a single semicolon:
; // null statement*/

/*A null statement is useful where the language requires a statement but the
program’s logic does not. Such usage is most common when a loop’s work can be
done within its condition.*/
